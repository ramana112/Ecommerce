            <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves.[1] Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
                    </p>
                    <p>Education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
                        </p>
                    <p> A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[2] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.

                        My favourite is cooking, listening music and gardening, however, I always prefer gardening it is like meditation to me which improves my work efficiency, interest and ability. It gives me a peace and happiness, makes my day useful. Every day in the morning I enjoy my blooming garden, growing plants slowly on daily basis. I also enjoy sun rise and sun set daily in my garden.

                    <p style="text-indent: 100px"> 
                        I generally like to do my school homework in my garden. I play games with my father daily in the evening in my garden. And enjoy an evening walk with my mother. I daily watch plants development and do watering the plant. I also try planting new and decorative plants to my garden in order to enhance its look and beauty.

                   I love to listen to music and it is my favourite hobby. At the free time and even during work I used to listen to music. As music relax the mind and reduces the stress from the mind. When I am working along with listening music, I finish my work very fast and easily without any disturbance. I like to listen to the soft and romantic music and songs.
